A [AeroSpace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace) status bar widget for [Übersicht](https://github.com/felixhageloh/uebersicht) forked from [simple-bar](https://github.com/Jean-Tinland/simple-bar)

[`simple-bar-server`](https://github.com/Jean-Tinland/simple-bar-server) is available to trigger refresh and toggle widgets more efficiently with `curl` commands.

## Features

Among the principal features of `simple-bar`, you'll find:

- **Show all opened apps** in every space
- **Show all opened windows** on the current space
- Interactions: **focus window** on click, launch scripts, toggle states
- Add your own custom widgets in settings (it displays scripts outputs)
- **Refresh and toggle parts of simple-bar on the fly** with `curl` commands by installing [simple-bar-server](https://www.jeantinland.com/toolbox/simple-bar-server/documentation/introduction/) and enabling the server in settings. See [widgets](https://www.jeantinland.com/toolbox/simple-bar-server/documentation/widgets/), or [AeroSpace](https://www.jeantinland.com/toolbox/simple-bar-server/documentation/aerospace/) options in its documentation
- **Extensible** themes system with 3 theme behaviors: **dark**, **light**, or **system**
- Numerous customization options, try them out in settings!
- A handfull selection of widgets

## Installation

Simply clone this repo in your Übersicht widgets directory with the following command.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nguymin4/simple-bar $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Übersicht/widgets/simple-bar
```

You'll find the full installation guide in the [documentation](https://www.jeantinland.com/toolbox/simple-bar/documentation/installation/).

> [!WARNING]\
> If you encounter this error: "simple-bar-index.jsx: Something went wrong…", it may be simply due to the fact that the default value for AeroSpace path is wrong in simple-bar. You can set this path in the settings module.\
> The default paths are `/opt/homebrew/bin/aerospace`.

> [!TIP]\
> If you experience some freezing issues with Übersicht or if you simply want to improve `simple-bar` responsiveness & energy consumption, please try to switch to `simple-bar-server` in order to trigger refresh with `curl` commands. You'll find more information about it in the repo [here](https://github.com/Jean-Tinland/simple-bar-server).

## Roadmap

Here are the features I'm planning to add in the future:

- Bars configurator (spawn multiple bars, place widgets anywhere…) [#380](https://github.com/Jean-Tinland/simple-bar/issues/380)
- More accessibility settings like reading direction (LTR or RTL)

Feel free to open an issue if you have any feature request or if you want me to prioritize one of these features.
